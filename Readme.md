The Grind is a procedurally generated faux-RPG for Android.  That is to say, all the statistcal elements from an RPG are there, but the actually work is not.  You can set The Grind on autopilot and let your adventurer happily collect gold and kill enemies and gain levels.  Thousands of real-world datatypes were imported to give the illusion of a fully realized world.  This is the source code respository for The Grind.
